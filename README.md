# BKK Bus Routes

## What is this?

Right now, not much. Maybe in the future it'll be something.

## Why is this?

I spent a few days in Bangkok and was very lost when trying to navigate the bus system as a non-Thai speaker.  Someone pointed me to [this great page](https://bazztsu.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html) which (as far as I know) shows the paths of all the bus routes in Bangkok - even the private bus lines not managed by the BMTA (these are not covered by Google Maps, Viabus, Moovit, or anyone really).
